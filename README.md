# Yada Wallet (ESP32 Hardware Wallet)

This project implements a **secure, air-gapped hardware wallet** using an ESP32 and an OLED screen. It is designed for **YadaCoin** key generation and **secure key rotation** using a password-protected derivation system inspired by BIP85 and the YadaCoin whitepaper.

## üîê Features

- Enter a 6-digit password (KDP) using **two buttons** (Ledger-style navigation)
- Derives a **root HD wallet** + 3 **child wallets**
- Each child uses a multi-rotation derivation for brute-force resistance
- Displays:
  - Public Address
  - 12-word mnemonic
  - WIF QR code
- Child wallets include a **pre-rotated key hash** for on-chain validation (key log security)

## üéÆ Controls

| Action                    | Button(s)           |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Cycle PIN digit           | Right button (D25)  |
| Confirm PIN digit         | Left button (D26)   |
| Cycle wallets (after PIN) | Left button         |

## üß† How It Works

1. **Password Input**
   - 6-digit PIN entered via buttons
   - Used as the passphrase in BIP32 HD wallet derivation

2. **Root Wallet**
   - Derived directly from the master seed + PIN
   - Displays full mnemonic and address

3. **Child Wallets**
   - Derived from custom path: `m/83696968'/39'/0'/12'/n'`
   - HMAC-SHA512 of child private key ‚Üí 128 bits entropy ‚Üí child mnemonic

4. **Key Log Hashing**
   - Public key from each child ‚Üí SHA256 hash
   - Printed to Serial Monitor as `Pre-rotated Key Hash`
   - Enables future blockchain-side validation
